    "In the Mirror World, your alternate self has cultivated an extraordinary ability to weave disparate concepts into harmonious innovations. Where you see limitations, they perceive infinite pathways. This version of you has learned to harness the chaotic energy of uncertainty, transforming it into a creative force that reshapes reality itself.\n\n" +
    "Your mirror self understands that vulnerability is not weakness but a profound source of connection. They have built bridges between worlds through authentic expression, bringing together communities that in your reality remain fragmented and isolated.\n\n" +
    "These capabilities exist within you as dormant potential, waiting to be awakened through conscious recognition and cultivation.",

  shadowEcho:
    "Where your mirror self embodies light, the shadow manifests darkness. This aspect resists vulnerability, preferring isolation to connection. It clings to certainty, stifling innovation through rigid thinking patterns. Your shadow rejects intuitive wisdom in favor of purely analytical approaches, disconnecting from the emotional intelligence that guides your authentic self.\n\n" +
    "The shadow is not your enemy, but a teacher. By acknowledging its presence, you gain awareness of the internal forces that may sometimes limit your highest potential."
