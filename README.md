Mirror World Interviewer is an interactive web app that transforms self-reflection into a surreal experience. It conducts a deeply introspective interview with the user, then uses AI to generate a “mirror-world” version of their personality — highlighting inner strengths, overlooked traits, and unrealized potential.
