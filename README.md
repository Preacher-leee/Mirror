🌌 Mirror World Interviewer
What if an AI could interview your soul, then show you the version of yourself you’ve been too blind to see?

Mirror World Interviewer is an interactive web app that transforms self-reflection into a surreal experience. It conducts a deeply introspective interview with the user, then uses AI to generate a “mirror-world” version of their personality — highlighting inner strengths, overlooked traits, and unrealized potential.

This isn’t your average quiz app. It’s a psychological portal. A self-discovery machine wrapped in poetic code.
